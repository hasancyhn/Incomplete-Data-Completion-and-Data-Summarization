# Incomplete-Data-Completion-and-Data-Summarization

This project consists of two main stages:

1- Missing Data Completion: The missing/lost data in the selected dataset will be completed using one of the missing data completion methods. You can choose the method yourself. If there is no missing data in the chosen dataset, you will create missing data by manipulating some of the data yourself. Your data completion module should have a dynamic structure. When presenting your application, you will be asked to create missing data on other data that you have determined.

2- Data Summarization and Presentation: After the data completion process in the second stage, the following operations need to be performed and presented for the obtained data:
a. Mean
b. Median
c. Mode
d. Frequency (Visualization is also required for this value. It will be presented graphically.)
e. Interquartile Range (IQR)
f. Outliers (You can use any method you prefer)
g. Five-number summary (Min, Q1, M, Q3, Max)
h. Box Plot (To be presented visually)
i. Variance and Standard Deviation
